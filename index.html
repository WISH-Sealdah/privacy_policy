    <h2>2. Location Data Usage</h2>

        reporting activities.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Location is collected only during active form submission</li>
        <li>No continuous or background location tracking is performed</li>
        <li>Location data is visible only to authorized supervisory users</li>

        <li>Sending reminders and notifications</li>
        <li>Improving app performance and user experience</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Smart Reminders & Notifications</h2>
    <p>
        The app may send push notifications such as scheduled visit reminders, form status updates, 
        and administrative instructions. These notifications are only related to official duties.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
        We implement internal security measures including encrypted storage, role-based access, 
        and controlled login to ensure employee data is protected from unauthorized access.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
        The information collected is used only within the Sealdah Division and associated 
        railway departments. No data is shared with third parties outside Indian Railways.

        This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time to reflect new features 
        or administrative requirements. Users will be notified of significant changes.
